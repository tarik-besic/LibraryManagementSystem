# LibraryManagementSystem

Fullstack web app

This project is a Library Management System which could be used in a High School.
It is not finished, I need to make 4-5 additional functionalities on frontend and few more api routes on backend.

## Technologies used:
-NodeJs/Express for backend

-Jquery for api calls

-MongoDB for Database

-EJS with HTML for dispaying information from database 

-Bootstrap for styling

-Postman for api testing
